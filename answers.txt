What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A rebase flattens the history into one single patch and integrates the new patch onto the target branch, in the process removing unwanted entries.
Git merge only changes the target branch and creates a commit, thus preserving the history of the source branch.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository are hosted on a server to be made accessible for all team members, rather than local which only resides on the computers of the team members.
